# sql-challenge
Module 9 challenge. In this challenge I was asked to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data for the employees in 1980 and 1990. 

In Data Modeling I used Quick DBD to create an ERD of all 6 csv files.
In Data Engineering I created tables for each of the 6 csv files.I specified the data types, primary keys, foreign keys.
In Data Analysis I created queries to answer the questions provided.
